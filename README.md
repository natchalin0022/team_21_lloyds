# Lloyds SME Lead-Scoring

Final group project, University of Bristol MSc Data Science.

A **lead-scoring model** that ranks UK SME companies by how likely they are to need new
lending, so Lloyds relationship managers (RMs) know who to approach first. Scope is
**lending only**. The output is a ranked list of **non-customers** who look like customers.

Two public data sources, no proprietary bank data:

| pillar | source | role |
|---|---|---|
| structured | **Companies House** API | age, sector, region, accounts, charge history — the workhorse |
| unstructured | **GDELT** via BigQuery | sector × region news volume, used as a soft re-rank |

---

## The two pipelines

The same five notebooks serve two different jobs. Run them in numbered order.

### Training side — build and evaluate the model

Run occasionally: once to build, then quarterly to retrain.

```
company_raw/*.csv                bulk Companies House company lists
      │
      ▼
1_CompaniesHouse.ipynb           Stage 1  profile pull (9 fields per company)
                                 Stage 2  flag the SME population
                                 Stage 3  charges + PSC
                                 Stage 4b charges_history.csv  ← the LABEL source
      │
      ▼
2_GDELT.ipynb                    Part 5   postcode → region   (required: a model feature)
                                 Part 3/4 sector × region media index (for the re-rank)
      │
      ▼
3_Flat_table.ipynb               features at ASOF=2021-01-01 + forward label
                                 →  API/flat_pot.csv.gz
      │
      ▼
4_model.ipynb                    LogReg (primary) · XGBoost · MLP (comparators)
                                 grid search, Precision@K, SHAP
                                 refit on ALL rows  →  Model/model.joblib + manifest
```

### Client side — score a real list

Run per engagement. **One pass through each notebook, in order.**

```
client/input/*.csv               what the client sends (see "Client input" below)
      │
      ▼
1_CompaniesHouse.ipynb           Stage 0  ingest client lists → company_raw/
                                 Stage 1  pull anyone not already held
                                 Stage 3  charges + PSC for the new SMEs
                                 Stage 4b rebuild charges_history.csv
      │
      ▼
2_GDELT.ipynb                    Part 5   region for the new companies
      │
      ▼
5_score.ipynb                    §1 read + repair      §5 exclude customers
                                 §2 coverage check     §6 soft re-rank
                                 §3 features as-of TODAY  §7 reason codes
                                 §4 score              §8 write   §9 checks
      │
      ▼
client/output/<date>/            leads.csv · not_found.csv · run_manifest.txt
```

**Stage 0 is what makes this linear.** It reads the same `client/input/*.csv` files that
notebook 5 will, and queues their company numbers for the pull — so by the time you reach
notebook 5, every company is already held and it runs once.

Notebook 3 is **not** in the client path: it builds the *training* table (past `ASOF` + a
label). Notebook 5 builds the *scoring* table (today, no label) using identical feature code.

---

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `.env` in this folder with your Companies House API keys (one per line, no quotes).
More keys = proportionally faster; the client paces each one to stay under the rate limit.

```
CH_API=your_key_here
CH_API_2=your_second_key
```

GDELT Parts 3–4 additionally need a Google Cloud project with BigQuery billing enabled
(`gcloud auth application-default login`). **Parts 3–4 are optional** — skip them and you
still get a working lead list, just without the media re-rank. Part 5 needs no credentials.

Verify the install — prints every path and whether it exists:

```bash
python paths.py
```

Most paths print `OK`. **These seven print `MISS` in a clean clone and are expected:**

| constant | why it is absent |
|---|---|
| `ENV_FILE` | you create `.env` yourself — see above |
| `FILINGS_CSV` | Stage 6 is disabled and nothing reads it |
| `ACCTYPE_CSV`, `SME_CSV` | legacy two-file layout, superseded by `companies.csv.gz` |
| `FLAT_CSV`, `PANEL_CSV` | retired designs; the constants remain only so older notebook copies still resolve |
| `LEADS_CSV` | an output — written when you run the pipeline |

Anything *else* printing `MISS` is a real problem.

### The data ships with the repo

**There is nothing to download.** Everything the pipeline needs to run is in the clone —
clone it, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and the notebooks work.

The three tables are stored **gzipped** so they fit inside GitHub's 100 MB per-file limit.
`paths.py` points at the `.gz`, and pandas reads and writes that format transparently from
the extension, so no notebook code differs because of it.

| file | in repo | uncompressed | needed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `companies.csv.gz` | 27 MB | 149 MB | every stage, and `5_score` |
| `charges_history.csv.gz` | 6 MB | 44 MB | the label and all charge features |
| `flat_pot.csv.gz` | 9 MB | 46 MB | `4_model` — the training table |

Also shipped: the GDELT Parquet caches, `Model/model.joblib` and its manifest, the client
input template, and the per-company **charge** JSON cache that `Stage 4b` rebuilds from.

Two things are deliberately **not** in the repo, and neither is needed:

- **`filings_history.csv` and the filing JSON cache.** Nothing reads them — `Stage 6` is
  disabled (see *The JSON cache* below). They were ~1.9 GB.
- **`.env` and real client lists.** API keys and customer data must never reach a public
  repository. Only the template ships.

You only need Companies House API keys if you intend to *pull fresh data*. Scoring a list
against the shipped tables needs no credentials at all.

### Paths

**`paths.py` is the single source of truth for every file location.** No notebook contains a
relative or absolute path. It derives the project root from its own location, so the notebooks
run from any working directory. Never hardcode a path; add a constant there instead.

### The JSON cache

`API/CompaniesHouse/company_info_json/` holds one raw JSON per company per endpoint
(`<com_num>_charges.json`, `<com_num>_filings.json`). It is a **cache, not a deliverable**:
everything in it can be re-fetched from the API. The **charge** JSONs ship with the repo
because `Stage 4b` rebuilds `charges_history.csv` from them; the filing JSONs do not, because
nothing reads them.

Nothing downstream reads the cache directly. Notebooks 2–5 work entirely from the two derived
tables, `companies.csv.gz` and `charges_history.csv.gz`, so **a list can be scored with the
cache absent.** Only `1_CompaniesHouse.ipynb` opens the JSONs, and only to rebuild those tables.

| | if the cache is deleted |
|---|---|
| **Stage 4** (charges) | **repairs itself** — it selects work by `Path.exists()` alone, so it re-fetches exactly the missing files (~105k companies, ~4.4 h on four keys) |
| **Stage 6** (filings) | **disabled by default** (`RUN_STAGE_6 = False`) and does not repair itself — its `todo` also requires `n_filings.isna()`, so a company whose count is already recorded can never be re-fetched. Blank `n_filings` in `companies.csv.gz` for those rows before re-enabling |

Stages 4b and 6 rebuild `charges_history.csv` and `filings_history.csv` *from the cache* and
make no API calls. Both **refuse to write** when the rebuild comes out more than 5% smaller than
the file already on disk, rather than silently replacing the label source with an empty table.
If you hit that error, restore the cache or run Stage 4 — do not delete the guard.

**Stage 6 is switched off.** Filing history is not used anywhere: the shipped model's 13
features come from the Stage 1 profile call and `charges_history.csv` alone, and neither
notebook 3 nor notebook 5 opens `filings_history.csv`. The stage is kept, disabled, as the
raw material for the point-in-time `account_type` fix under *Known limitations*. Set
`RUN_STAGE_6 = True` in that cell to re-enable it.

---

## Client input

The client sends **one CSV** (or several — every `.csv` directly in `client/input/` is read;
subfolders are ignored). Template: `client/input/Template/client_companies_TEMPLATE.csv`.

| column | required | purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `company_number` | **yes** | the only reliable key |
| `company_name` | no | for their own checking; ignored |
| `relationship` | **yes** | `customer` → excluded from leads · `prospect` → scored |

Everything else — sector, region, age, charge history — comes from Companies House. The client
supplies **who to cross off**, not what the companies are like.

**Send company numbers, not names.** Name matching is unreliable and cannot safely resolve
"10 Castlebar Ltd" to one company. Rows without a valid number are reported back, never guessed.

**Leading zeros:** 28% of UK company numbers start with `0` and Excel strips them. The pipeline
repairs this automatically (`zfill(8)`), so send the file as-is rather than hand-fixing it.

---

## Outputs

`client/output/<date>/` — dated, never overwritten, because comparing this quarter's list
against next quarter's customer list is the only way to measure whether the leads converted.

| file | contents |
|---|---|
| `leads.csv` | top-K ranked, with a plain-language reason per lead |
| `not_found.csv` | every company **not** in the leads and **why** |
| `run_manifest.txt` | model version, ASOF, coverage, counts — traceability |

`not_found.csv` matters as much as `leads.csv`: "here are your leads, and here are the 43
numbers we could not match" is what makes the first file trustworthy.

---

## How it works

**Label.** A company is positive if a **Lloyds Banking Group entity** (Lloyds Bank, Bank of
Scotland, Halifax, Black Horse, Lex Autolease, …) appears as the lender on a registered charge.
Matched by a curated regex in Stage 3, which deliberately excludes "Lloyd's of London" and
"**Royal** Bank of Scotland".

**Forward-looking by construction.** Features are measured at `ASOF`; the label is the first
Lloyds charge in `(ASOF, LABEL_END]`. Getting this backwards answers "who *resembles* a
customer" rather than "who *will become* one".

**Existing customers are excluded** at `ASOF`. Every row is a genuine prospect, so the lead list
is simply the top of the ranking.

**Point-in-time discipline.** Charge features are cut at `ASOF`; non-Lloyds charges are allowed
as features (proven-borrower signal), Lloyds charges never are — they are the label.

**Evaluation** is Precision@K and lift at true prevalence, never accuracy. At 0.33% prevalence
accuracy is meaningless.

### The one rule to preserve

**The feature definitions in `5_score.ipynb` §3 must match `3_Flat_table.ipynb` §4 exactly.**
The definitions *are* the model. If they drift, the coefficients get applied to a different
quantity and scores become meaningless **without anything erroring**. Notebook 5 §4 validates
the built columns against the model manifest as a backstop.

## Scale (current build)

| | |
|---|---|
| companies pulled | 839,344 (**567,883** SMEs — the modelling population) |
| charge records | 399,706 (39,883 Lloyds-group) |
| training table | 360,600 rows, **1,203 positives** (0.33%) |
| features | 13 |
| media index | 21 sectors × 11 regions × 93 weeks |
| shipped model | LogReg, refit on all rows |

---

## Known limitations

Stated plainly because they matter for interpreting results.

1. **Population is a sample.** 567,883 SMEs, not the full UK register. Representativeness was
   checked across the twelve source slices: Lloyds prevalence 2.23–2.93% for all slices above
   45,000 companies. Two small early slices (1.16–1.47%, 1.6% of rows) reflect a known
   name-ordering artefact. Full deployment would use the Companies House **bulk data product**
   for company attributes, reserving API calls for charge histories.

2. **Positive-Unlabelled.** Lloyds lending that leaves no registered charge (unsecured,
   overdrafts, cards) is invisible. On the client side this disappears — their CRM knows.

3. **Three features are current snapshots**, not point-in-time: `account_type`,
   `accounts_overdue`, `sector`. Mild leakage. `filings_history.csv` (Stage 6) is the raw
   material to fix it; the features are not built, so Stage 6 ships disabled.

4. **Yorkshire has no media cells** — the region never matched GDELT's location spellings.
   Those leads get a neutral re-rank rather than a wrong one.

5. **The media re-rank is a tie-breaker, not a performance claim.** Sector-only `vol_z` showed
   **no signal** once seasonality was controlled (p=0.86). Sector × region did (z=+6.77 on real
   cells) but **not monotonically** — the hottest quintile sits at 0.97× chance. Hence
   `GATE_WEIGHT = 0.15`, real cells only, and nothing ever dropped.

6. **Scores are ranking values, not calibrated probabilities.** `class_weight="balanced"`
   inflates them deliberately. Report a rank, never "a 39% chance of borrowing".

7. **This is a prioritisation aid, not a credit decision.** It ranks who to call. It does not
   assess creditworthiness. PSC personal attributes (DOB, nationality) are deliberately excluded
   on fair-lending grounds.

## Repository layout

```
1_CompaniesHouse.ipynb    Stages 0–6: pull and assemble Companies House data
2_GDELT.ipynb             media index (Parts 3–4) + postcode → region (Part 5)
3_Flat_table.ipynb        training table  → API/flat_pot.csv
4_model.ipynb             train, evaluate, ship  → Model/model.joblib
5_score.ipynb             score a client list    → client/output/<date>/
paths.py                  every file location — import, never hardcode

API/CompaniesHouse/company_data/
    companies.csv.gz      one row per company ever pulled (is_sme flags the population)
    charges_history.csv.gz  one row per charge — the label source
    filings_history.csv   Stage 6 output; unused — Stage 6 is disabled by default
    company_raw/          bulk company lists + ingested client lists
API/CompaniesHouse/company_info_json/    per-company charge/filing JSON (~600k files)
                          a rebuildable cache, safe to omit — see "The JSON cache"
API/GDELT/BigQuery Cache files/          Parquet caches — never re-query if present
API/flat_pot.csv.gz       the training table
Model/                    model.joblib + model_manifest.json
client/input/             what the client sends (gitignored except the template)
client/output/<date>/     what you hand back
```

**`.env` and real client lists are gitignored** — API keys and customer data must never
reach the repository or a code submission. Only the input template and the per-run
`run_manifest.txt` files ship.

**The BigQuery caches are the expensive artefact.** A fresh 104-week pull scans ~350 GB against
a 1 TB/month free tier. `USE_CACHE = True` / `USE_CACHE_REGION = True` load them for 0 GB —
leave them alone unless you deliberately want fresh data.
